Hey there!

I'm Tamas, a Solutions Architect / Consultant living in the UK. I've been tinkering with computers since I was a child, which eventually turned into a passion - and a full-time job.

Currently I'm working @ Amazon Web Services helping various Healthcare customers make the best out of the cloud :)

I'm a proud dad of 2 kittens - Basil & Rosemary.

In this blog I talk about interesting stuff I come across during my day-to-day job, but I also write about topics and technologies that are close to my heart.

If you have any questions, or comments about my posts, feel free to get in touch!
